This application is written for the purpose of performing a test task. About 2 days were spent on writing. 
The purpose of the application is to receive information from the server and display it on the screen. Application concept: blog of motorists.

The following tools were used to develop the application:
 - Hilt
 - Adaptive dimensions
 - Navigation Components
 - Lottie
 - Glide
 - Retrofit
 - ViewPager2

To write the application, I used design patterns: pure architecture, MVVM, modular structure.
